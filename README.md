Oracle NetSuite is a cloud business software suite for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), managing inventory, tracking financial transactions, hosting e-commerce stores, and maintaining Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. This module allows you to access the NetSuite's SuiteTalk SOAP Web services API through Ballerina. 

The NetSuite connector can execute CRUD (create, read, update, delete) and search operations to perform business processing on NetSuite records and to navigate dynamically between records.
